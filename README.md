# SP_Global_convolution_task

The repository contains ***solution written from scratch*** for Homework Task given during the SPGI-R2 interview. 

## Problem Statement: 
Write python code to apply convolution operation on a image of size 100*100*3 with kernel size of 3*3 in broadcasting manner. Can have dynamic padding, stride for the conv

Note: can only use `Numpy`, refer the implementation of Scipy convolution operation, avoid For loops


### Proposed Solution :
Refer the code provided in above file
